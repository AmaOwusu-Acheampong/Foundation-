    <p>
        The transition from a student’s previous level of qualification to university can be a very hard hurdle for students to overcome as it involves adapting to a new environment, learning new skills, making new friends, amongst others.
    </p>
    <p>
        Foundation year, a program offered by many universities, including The University of Manchester, serves as the bridge between a student’s previous level qualification and their degree. 
        It serves as a cushion to consolidate some academic concepts so students are more 'ready' for their course.
        This can also relieve some of the stresses associated with the transition.
    </p>

    <p>
        The experience one acquires from the foundation year is one that cannot be understimated. Since the foundation year is the bridge the gap between A level and the university, skills such as study skills, working under pressure, adaptation to a new environment are aquired.
    </p>

    <p>
        Approaches to teaching and learning at the University can be entirely different from A levels. There are more asynchronous sessions compared to the synchronous sections. One must therefore learn to study effectively on their own.
