<p></p>

As you might expect, at university you are required to work way more on your own. In this particular module, you'll be taught a concept and will have to work in groups in order to figure out the problems outside of classroom.

<p></p>

You'll find yourself, more often than not, working in groups and brainstorming in order to find a good solution for a set problem. 

<p></p>

Furthermore, while in sixth form the work was very reliant on class time, at university, not so much. These hours spent with your group are very valuable and, essentially, the basis of the course (and your assessment).

<p></p>

Research is also a big part of the course. You'll be researching new technologies and how to use them very often. These will be used for your projects, for example, you'll have to learn HTML and CSS and build your website, as we're doing now.

<p></p>

There is also a change of environment. All the people in your course, would've chosen it and are there willingly, which makes it so people around you are interested in the same subjects as you. Moreover, as mentioned before, you will be much more independent and will have more responsibilities. 

<p>
    A skill to learn in the foundation year is the ability to cope with the pace things are taught at. 
    One of the courses in foundation year, about pure mathematics, is separated into two different subjects based on the students level of qualification and understanding: Mathematics OB1 and OC1. 
    The 0C mathematics is for students less comfortable with the mathematics taught at university. While the 0B is for those with a more advanced background.
