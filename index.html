    <b><u style="text-decoration-color: #17689a;"><span style="color:#17689a">Computational Thinking:</span></u></b> The thought processes involved in formulating a problem and expressing its solutions in such a way that a computer - human or machine - can effectively carry it out.</p>

    I would say <span style='color:#17689a'> computational thinking</span> is about solving problems in an algorithmic and deterministic way. Meaning that, the module is about giving instruction, in this case, to a computer so that it only has one 'choice' at all times.

    <p>This term is used to describe the processes that can be used to develop solutions for complex problems. It uses a number of approaches, such as:
        <ul>
            <li>Decompose and analyse a problem</li>
            <li>Design and refine solutions for a problem</li>
            <li>Present these solutions in ways that can effectively be carried out by machines or humans</li>
            <li>Analyse and compare these solutions</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    This subject should not be seen as a unit on coding/programming but rather, a unit teaching how to think in simple steps. The contents from this can be applied to more than just code development. Some of the Intended Learning Outcomes (ILOs) include:
    <ul>
        <li>The ability to decompose a problem into a series of ordered steps</li>
        <li>Apply techniques such as decomposition, abstraction and generalisation to problems</li>
        <li>Describe computational complexity in an informal way</li>
        <li>Explain how self-referential problems relate to the limits of computation</li>
    </ul> 

    <p>
        <h3><u>Format</u></h3>
    The course is run in a series of 6 <b>blocks</b>, each of them starting with a <b>workshop</b> and lasting <b>two weeks.</b> This is complemented by asynchronous content such as videos and additional reading.
    </p>

    <p>
        <h3><u>Assessment</u></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>End of semester exam - 50%</li>
            <li>Group coursework - 40%
                <ul>
                <li>Blocks 2-5 require a submitted solution, each of these will count 10%</li>
                <li>Assessment for Block 1 is formative only so take this opportunity to learn and improve your next solutions</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
